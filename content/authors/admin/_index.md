I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at UCLA, advised by [Dr.Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/) and affiliating with [VCLA lab](https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/people.html). I study robotics and artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on robot learning, planning and reasoning. [CV](files/cv.pdf).

My current reseach is supported by [DARPA XAI](), [ONR MURI Scene Understanding]() and [DARPA SIMPLEX]().
